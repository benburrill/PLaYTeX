    This example document shows the use of PLaYTeX.

    Let's start off with the ``hello'' player from playtex-players.yaml.
    To use it, we run \verb|\PlaytexLatex{hello}|: \PlaytexLatex{hello}


    For something a little more interesting, we can use matplotlib to
    create charts with \verb|\PlaytexMatplotlib{hello}|:

    \PlaytexMatplotlib{mpl}

    Pretty cool, huh?
